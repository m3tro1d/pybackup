# pybackup
Basic backup routine written in python.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
First off, you need to configure the program to your needs. Modify the settings in `pybackup.ini` file according to the instructions.

Then, just run the script in terminal:
```
python pybackup.py
```

This will store all marked files in a nice bunch of zip archives.

__Note__: archive files will be replaced with the new ones each time you run the script, so be careful.
