# This INI file is used to configure which directories are backed up

# Add directories and their corresponding archive name by using archiveN
# and directoriesN. This way all directories, listed in directoriesN will be
# added to the archiveN.
# Archive name and directories must be in a right place! Archive name first,
# then directories. Else the file will be parsed incorrectly.
